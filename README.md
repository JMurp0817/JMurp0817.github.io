## Welcome to my Gihub.IO

Currently studying computer science at Boise State University. I enjoy working with my peers to assemble new ideas and bring them to light. Througout my college career I have put together a few projects that showcase some of my skills as an engineer and developer.

### CS 455 Distributed Systems Identity Server

This project consisted of designing and creating a server to store, create, and maintain a database of users using remote procedure calls. I worked on this in a team where we put together a thorough design before dividing and working on separate portions of the project before bringing it together and consolidating our work into a useful program.
